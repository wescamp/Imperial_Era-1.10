    description= _ "Any Arendian clan only supports and upkeeps the best archers out of war time. Training neww archers is never a priority. This means that any archers who do join the clan's army in times of need are usually hunters from the clans or towns, those already familiar with their weapons. They have little to no armour, and whatever bow they use at their homes, typically a handmade hunting bow, or a family heirloom. They are also normally expected to hunt for their own food, and supply their own arrows.
 But in the end all of this is worth it, for any archers who do get accepted as regulars are treated well with good pay and food."
