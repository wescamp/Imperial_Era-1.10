    description= _ "The great Lavinian general Gnaeus Junius Cursor once reported that Arendian druids practice human sacrifice. True or not, they is certainly something mysterious about these secretive scholar-priests of Arendia. What is known is that they regard the oak, the holly, and the mistletoe as sacred; that they gather in various colleges scattered throughout Arendia; that they are healers; and that they are masters in the use of the harsh element of fire.
