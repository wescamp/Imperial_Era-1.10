    description= _ "The windrunners are the finest scouts available to the sidhe. Their speed is unbelievable, and their prowesses with their spears, whether thrown or in hand to hand, are amazing.

Special notes: Their primary spear they coat with the sap of a certain shrub, giving it a poisonout tinge, but they would consider it cowardly to do this for their javelins as well."
